# Moving to Godot
I have realized that Love2D might not be the best framework to use for this project. Therefore, I am switching to Godot for further development at https://github.com/Ovionyx/SlashRhythm

## Install
    1. download or clone this repository
    2. download and install love2d (https://love2d.org)
    3. drag and drop the folder into the love2d.exe

## Options 
    options are in options.lua


## To select chart
    open options.lua

    change the value of the variable "chart" to the name of the chart you want to play(the folder name in charts)
